A lightweight REST API + Frontend to get Insights into your Civilisation VI data!
Technologies:
- Programming Language: GO
- Database and Database Migration: sqlite (Turso) and goose
- Router: [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/tree/master)
- CI using Github Actions
- CD using docker and gcloud (currently not in use!)
- Simple Frontend with HTML, CSS and JS

(Upcoming) Features:

- Calculate and Visualize Stats.
- Add friends for your User and to your Games, see their stats or combined stats for yourself and multiple others.
- "Wiki" like pages for Different Nations and Leaders showcasing their typical win conditions, winrates and others stats.

Project Goals:
Code a stable and secure backend using GO and raw SQL (sqlite) instead of sqlc
Create a simple and light weight frontend for User Interaction.
CI using Github Actions for Testing, Stylechecks/linting, ...
Remote Database using Turso

Optional Long Term Goals:
CD using docker+gcloud.
Improve Frontend to have great looking visualization for the statistics.
